<-----------------Pandas and NumPy-------------> 
            <-------difference--------->

Pandas and NumPy are both powerful libraries in Python, but they serve different purposes 
and are designed for different types of data manipulation and analysis.

<-------------Data Structures:------------->
NumPy: Primarily provides support for working with homogeneous numerical 
arrays (i.e., arrays of the same data type). The core data structure in NumPy is the ndarray
(n-dimensional array).

Pandas: Provides two primary data structures 
- Series and DataFrame.
Series is one-dimensional and can hold any data type, while DataFrame is a two-dimensional 
tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).

<----------------Data Types:------------------>
NumPy: Works with homogeneous numerical data types. It is optimized for numerical operations 
and is well-suited for mathematical and scientific computations.

Pandas: Supports heterogeneous data types, making it more suitable for working with real-world 
datasets where columns may have different types of data.

<-----------------Use Cases:------------------->
NumPy: Ideal for numerical operations, mathematical functions, and working with arrays in a 
mathematical context. It's the foundation for many other scientific computing libraries in Python.

Pandas: Designed for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. 
It's well-suited for working with tabular data, such as CSV files, Excel sheets, SQL tables, etc.

<----------------Functionality:----------------->
NumPy: Focuses on numerical and mathematical operations, providing functions for linear algebra, 
random number generation, Fourier analysis, etc.

Pandas: Focuses on data manipulation and analysis, providing functionalities for data cleaning, 
reshaping, merging, and handling missing data.

<-------------------Indexing:-------------------->
NumPy: Relies on integer-based indexing for arrays.
Pandas: Supports more flexible and labeled indexing. You can use labels or integer-based indexing, and it provides powerful indexing and selection methods.

<------------------Integration:------------------>
NumPy: Often used in conjunction with other libraries for tasks like plotting, statistical analysis, 
and machine learning.

Pandas: Seamlessly integrates with NumPy and other libraries, and it's a common choice for data 
preprocessing in machine learning workflows.

In summary, while NumPy is focused on numerical operations and homogeneous arrays,
Pandas is designed for working with heterogeneous tabular data, providing more high-level data manipulation tools. They are often used together in data analysis workflows, with Pandas building on top of the foundation provided by NumPy.
